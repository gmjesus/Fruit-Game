# Fruit-Game
Grade 11 High School Project - The Fruit Game

  The purpose of the this program is to create a game similar to
  "The Fruit Game" from http://www.2020tech.com/fruit/. At the start of the game 
  there will be three piles of fruit: lemons, oranges, and bananas. The objective 
  of the game is to take the very last fruit from the table. The number of lemons 
  can vary between 5-7, the number of oranges can vary between 3-5, and the number 
  of bananas can vary between 1-3. The user will then choose if they want to go first, 
  if they say "no"; the computer will then go first. The user is not allowed to skip
  a turn. During the user's turn they must remove a certain number of fruit
  from only a pile. The user may not take two different types of fruit during
  one turn. The user will be asked two different questions, the type of
  fruit they would want to remove, and how many to remove from the pile.
  Once there are no fruit left, the game will end. Whoever took the last
  turn will win the game.
